# diceAPI
I want to generate a number of random numbers, available over the internet. 

1D4, 2D12, etc...

On running this with `npm run dev`, localhost:/3/8 should return 3 random numbers from 1-8. 

This is an Express backend that will be ran via a docker image and available 
via a reverse proxy. 

I'll be running it on tonydiethelm.life/dice. 



## Setting this up as a docker image


## Setting a reverse proxy with Caddy
